# node_installer
Auto installer for  installing node for MateableCoin

With this script it will download everything with one click  
I will have it where you can run a wallet too but you will have manually set that up 

1. 
Make file as executable:
chmod +x install-full-node.sh
2.
Then run ./install-full-node.sh
